## Steps to start

- `npm install` the packages
- `npm run dev` to start the webpack dev server that will compile and serve the frontend
- go to `localhost:8080`
- look at `index.html` to start understanding how the files in `src` translate to HTML in the browser

Any changes you make to files inside the `src` folder will cause the dev server to recompile and serve the updated frontend
